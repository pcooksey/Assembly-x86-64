# Assembly-x86-64
This is just a small personal project on trying to learn Assembly, specifically x86-64, and building simple tools like a calculator in order to better under Assembly and computer architecture in general. The tools will mostly be a documentation for learning rather than productive useful tools as I suspect they won't be full of modern optimizations.
